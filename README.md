# DaysDifferenceCalculator

Days Difference Calculator is a simple Java Program which calculates number of days between two dates. 
The program does not utilize JAVA's existing Calendar or Date class.

Download the .java source file and compile it, or directly use the .class file and run on your machine where the JVM is running.

User will be asked to enter Day (DD), Month (MM) and Year (YYYY) for the First Date and Second Date. Please enter only valid 
integer values without spaces.

There is no validation kept as the purpose of the code is just to explain the logic of how to calculate days between two dates.

Also, I have made an assumption that the first date entered is always smaller compared to the second date. So kindly enter data
accordingly. Otherwise the desired output may not be correct.

To explain the logic, I have mentioned some code comments. I hope, its understandable. ;)
